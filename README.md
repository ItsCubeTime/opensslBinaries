# opensslBinaries

To use, you need to add the path where the folder "usr" is located (same folder as the openssl.exe is in the zip) to your PATH system environment variable

openSSL from git-scm version 2.36.1.windows.1.zip was extracted out of `C:\Program Files\Git\usr` with a copy installed from https://git-scm.com/ - the program will not run without the bundled DLLs as well as the cnf (config) file
